## 🚀 What's Happening Behind the Scenes

### Event Syncing Flow
1. **Job Application** → Backend creates Cyan event
2. **Interview Scheduled** → Backend creates Red event
3. **Recruitment Drive** → Backend creates Blue event
4. **Events Stored** → MongoDB + Google Calendar
5. **Website Display** → CalendarPage fetches & displays

### Data Storage
- ✅ MongoDB stores event metadata
