## Known Limitations

⚠️ **Current Implementation Notes:**
1. Events fetched from backend API only (MongoDB)
2. Real Google Calendar accessed directly by users if needed
3. Event colors fixed (not customizable per user)
4. No event creation from frontend (backend only)
5. No event deletion from frontend (read-only view)

✅ **These are by design** - matches requirements for Option 3 (view-only calendar)
